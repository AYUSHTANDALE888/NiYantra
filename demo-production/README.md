# Demo video production

A product showcase of the AICTE Demo Website, produced from the real running app. Every frame inside the app is a screen recording of genuine interactions on a freshly reset demo database with synthetic accounts. The edit only adds overlays: chapter cards, zooms, spotlights, callouts, subtitles, sound.

| Output | Length | File |
|---|---|---|
| Main cut, 1920×1080, 30 fps, H.264/AAC, −16 LUFS, chapter markers | ≈ 5:50 | `out/aicte-demo-main.mp4` (not committed: ~95 MB; run `./render.sh`) |
| Short cut (fair clock, yearly rules, trust) | ≈ 2:30 | `out/aicte-demo-short.mp4` |
| Subtitles (same text and timing as the burned-in ones) | | `out/main.srt`, `out/short.srt` |
| Chapter list for YouTube | | `out/main.chapters.txt` |

## What is here

| Path | What it is |
|---|---|
| `FEATURE_INVENTORY.md` | Phase 1 audit: architecture and every feature with route, role, test steps, success condition and verification status. |
| `STORYBOARD.md` | Chapters, each in the pattern purpose → real interaction → verified result → takeaway, and how the six editing principles are applied. |
| `PLAN.md` | Execution plan and stages. |
| `narration/script.json` | Narration text per chapter and part (A purpose, B interaction, C result, D takeaway), with an emotion level per line. |
| `narration/audio/` | One WAV per line + `timings.json` (duration, what speech-to-text heard, word error rate, word timings). |
| `narration/samples/` | The voice comparison (Kokoro and Chatterbox) used to choose the voice. |
| `audio/sfx/` | Synthesised, licence-free sounds: click, key taps, whoosh, pop, chime, soft "refused" tone, riser (`automation/make_sfx.py`; its old sine-pad bed is no longer used). |
| `automation/make_music.py` | The music: an original soft, warm arrangement at 70 bpm with no drums (slow electric-piano broken chords, warm pad, gentle acoustic bass, slow strings) composed in code, played on the MuseScore General soundfont with FluidSynth, darkened above 6.5 kHz and dipped at 2.5 kHz to leave room for the voice. Built to each cut's exact length so the last chord rings out under the closing card. |
| `automation/master_voice.py` | Narration mastering: 48 kHz, low cut, presence, softer sibilance, gentle compression, every line at −18 LUFS. |
| `automation/lib/recorder.mjs` | Recorder: Chrome screencast frames → constant-rate MP4, injected cursor with click ripple, and a log of every click, keystroke, upload, result and narration cue. |
| `automation/record.mjs` | The nine chapter scenarios. Each step asserts the real outcome on screen or through the API; a failed assertion stops the recording. |
| `automation/narrate.py` | Chatterbox narration with breath pauses between sentences; each line is transcribed with faster-whisper and regenerated if it does not match the script. |
| `automation/build-timeline.mjs` | Edit decisions from the logs: 1× while the voice speaks and around results, faster through typing and loading (shown with a speed badge). |
| `automation/make-srt.mjs` | Subtitles, chapter list and MP4 chapter metadata from the same timeline. |
| `recordings/<ch>/` | Raw recordings (`<ch>.mp4`) and event logs (`<ch>.events.json`), plus `state.json` (the case filed in chapter 2). |
| `remotion/` | Remotion 4 project (React/TypeScript): `Main` and `Short` compositions. |
| `render.sh` | One command for everything. |

## Render

```bash
# Prerequisites: the local stack running (npm run dev, two schedulers), ffmpeg, Chromium (Playwright's),
# fluidsynth + musescore-general-soundfont (apt), Python packages mido pyloudnorm pedalboard scipy soundfile.
cd demo-production/remotion && npm install && cd ..
./render.sh                 # edit and render both cuts from the existing recordings and narration
./render.sh --record        # re-record all chapters first (resets the demo database)
./render.sh --narrate       # regenerate the narration first (Chatterbox, CPU, about 25 minutes)
./render.sh main            # only the main cut
```

Narration setup (once): a Python 3.13 virtualenv with `torch==2.6.0 torchaudio==2.6.0 chatterbox-tts faster-whisper "setuptools<81"`; point `TTS_PY` at its `python`. Chatterbox downloads its model from Hugging Face on first use.

Preview and fine-tune in Remotion Studio: `cd remotion && npx remotion studio`.

## How the editing principles are implemented

1. **Guide the viewer's eyes.** The camera eases toward each element just before it is used and toward each verified result, then eases back out (`remotion/src/camera.ts`). Results get a spotlight that dims the rest of the screen.
2. **Show where you are.** A bottom band shows the chapter number and title, a progress bar of all chapters, who is signed in, and the prototype disclaimer. A banner appears whenever the signed-in person changes.
3. **Show cause and effect.** When a result appears, a dotted arrow runs from the click that caused it to the change, and a callout names the outcome (green for success, red for a refusal or block).
4. **Explain alongside the interface.** Subtitles with word-by-word highlighting, and short callouts placed next to the element, never over the field in use.
5. **Make interactions readable.** Visible cursor with click ripples (in the footage), an extra click pulse after zooming, a "Typing · field" chip, a "file attached" chip, clear click and key sounds, a speed badge whenever time is compressed.
6. **Organise into chapters.** Nine chapter cards, chapter markers inside the MP4, and a chapter list for YouTube.

## Sound

- **Voice first.** Narration is mastered to one level; the mix keeps it on top at all times.
- **Music that gets out of the way.** The bed dips about 5 dB smoothly whenever someone speaks (0.3 s down, 0.9 s back up; gaps under 1.4 s are bridged so it never pumps between sentences) and sits about 22 dB under the voice. It is a little fuller on the opening and closing cards.
- **Interface sounds you can hear but do not notice.** Clicks, a soft pop for each verified result, a gentle two-note tone for refusals, a whoosh when the signed-in person changes. Typing is thinned to one tap per 75 ms with slight level variation, so fast-forwarded input does not rattle.
- **Even loudness.** Two passes: measure, then one linear gain to −16 LUFS with a transparent peak limiter at −1.5 dB, so nothing is squashed.

## Honesty notes

- No interaction is simulated or drawn: every on-screen action is a real click or keystroke in the running app, and every callout points at text the app itself displayed.
- Time compression is visible (speed badge), never hidden.
- Time travel and the tampering step are demo tools and are labelled as such. The terminal card shows the exact command and its real output.
- The form-check model is shown in its real state ("Model unavailable: rules only" when the Python service is not running); the narration does not claim more.
- Synthetic data only; no real people, institutions or credentials. Rule values are placeholders.
